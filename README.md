# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is a template for building full stack apps with expo, its intended to be built locally with expo prebuild + expo run:ios for faster local development.

The project uses expo router + server output with server routes that are deployed with eas deploy.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

2. Start the app

```bash
   bun expo start
```

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Learn more

To learn more about developing your project with Expo, look at the following resources:

- [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/): Learn fundamentals, or go into advanced topics with our [guides](https://docs.expo.dev/guides).
- [Learn Expo tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/): Follow a step-by-step tutorial where you'll create a project that runs on Android, iOS, and the web.

## Tech Stack

This project uses a modern React Native stack with the following key technologies:

### Core Technologies

- [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/): A framework and platform for universal React applications, providing a set of tools and services for building native iOS, Android, and web apps.
- [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/): A file-based router for React Native and web applications, enabling universal navigation patterns.

### UI Components and Styling

- [Gluestack UI](https://ui.gluestack.io/): A universal UI library for React Native, web, and Expo applications. It provides:

  - Pre-built accessible components
  - Customizable theming
  - Support for both mobile and web platforms
  - Components used in this project include:
    - Actionsheet
    - Alert & Alert Dialog
    - Avatar
    - Button
    - Form Controls
    - Modal
    - And more...

- [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/): Tailwind CSS for React Native, allowing you to use Tailwind classes in your mobile app.

### Database and ORM

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs): Our database and authentication solution, providing:
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview): A TypeScript ORM for SQL databases that we will use typesafe queries

### Development Tools

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/): A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime and package manager
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): For type-safe JavaScript development
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): For code quality and consistent formatting
